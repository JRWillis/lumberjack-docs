# Notable Mentions

We just want to say thanks to a handful of projects, without which we wouldn't have been able to build Lumberjack.

## Rareloop

A lot of blood, sweat and tears \(of joy\) went into building Lumberjack. We have spent years working with WordPress and always strived to write maintainable code quickly. We're genuinely excited about the future of Lumberjack!

## Laravel

We use [Laravel](https://laravel.com) an awful lot at [Rareloop](https://rareloop.com), and basically wanted something that felt like Laravel but in WordPress. Rather than re-inventing the wheel we were heavily inspired by how Laravel works under the hood as well as all the awesome features they have aimed at rapid application development \(RAD\).

## Timber

We love [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/#whats-timber). It took away a lot of the pain of working with WordPress and is a great base for us to build Lumberjack on.
